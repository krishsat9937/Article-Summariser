## Article Autosummariser

The Autosummariser is a useful tool for summarising long documents, such as essays, articles, or reports. It can also be used to create summaries of shorter texts, such as email messages or blog posts. To use the Autosummariser, paste the text of the document into the text box and click the 'Summarise' button. The summarised text will then be displayed in the 'Summary' text box.

The Autosummariser uses a variety of algorithms to determine which sentences are the most important. It takes into account factors such as sentence length, position in the document, and the number of times a sentence is repeated.
